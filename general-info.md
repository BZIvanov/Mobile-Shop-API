## Stylings

React Native uses flex box by default. It works similarly as it works in normal css.

## Events

We can't use events on custom components, for example onPress on one of our components. The event has to be on a native component, for example View.

## Debugging

In the emulator device press ctrl+m and and select _Debug Remote JS_ option and you can debug in the browser which is helpful, because you can use breakpoints and track issues on sources files.
